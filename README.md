# Operating Systems - Thread Management

## Implemented the Thread Management system of OSP2 simulation software according to the following scheme
## Threads are scheduled according to the total time each thread has been using the CPU. The more CPU time a thread has used, the lower its priority is. 
### When a thread is dispatched, it is given a CPU time slice of 100 time units. If the thread is still running at the end of its time slice, it is preempted and put back into the ready queue.
